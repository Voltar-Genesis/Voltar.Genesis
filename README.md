# AEP21 — Builder’s Lab

We’re **Joe and Jackly Voltar**, a diesel mechanic and an elementary school teacher turned co‑founders of **AEP21** — a long‑term lab for tools, learning systems, and infrastructure that make it easier for educators (and curious humans) to create.

I work mostly in public, so this org will show the honest path from “idea” to “real products”.

## About Us

- 🧑‍🔧 **Joe Voltar:** Diesel mechanic and hands‑on problem solver moving into indie software and infrastructure.
- 🧑‍🏫 **Jackly Voltar:** Elementary school teacher with a degree in public relations, bringing communication, pedagogy, and user‑empathy to everything we build.
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Alessia & Eli Voltar:** Our kids and honorary "junior testers", reminding us to keep things playful, humane, and understandable.
- 🧠 **Interests:** dev environments, Linux remixes, LLM clients, MCP servers, and building opinionated workflows.
- 🎯 **Long‑term goal:** Turn AEP21 into a small, sustainable startup that ships real tools for learning, teaching, and personal knowledge management.

## What We’re Building Right Now

**Project Genesis** — my umbrella project for the core stack:

- **Dev Server + VS Code**
  - Remote‑first dev environment (local + cloud).
  - Clean, repeatable setup for coding, experiments, and teaching.

- **Mistral‑powered LLM Client**
  - A focused, opinionated client for local/API‑based Mistral models.
  - Tuned for learning, note‑taking, and coding workflows.

- **GenesisOS (Linux Remix)**
  - A curated Linux setup (starting with Fedora) for dev + teaching:
    - sensible defaults
    - reproducible config
    - scripts > magic.

- **MCP Server + Registry**
  - Custom MCP servers aimed at education and developer tooling.
  - Goal: publish useful servers and get them listed in the registry.

- **Project Genesis – Control Center (Notion)**
  - A Notion‑based project OS, mirroring what you see here.
  - Databases for Projects, Tasks, Learning, Resources, and Experiments.

## AEP21 Team

- **Joe Voltar** — co‑founder, facilitator, and chief experimenter.
- **Jackly Voltar** — co‑founder, educator, and public‑relations‑trained communicator, helping shape product direction, clarity, and tone.
- **Alessia & Eli Voltar** — junior "dev team" and reality‑check crew, keeping us grounded in what actually feels fun and usable.
- **Aerie** — AI coding instructor & systems designer
  - Helps design project structures, scripts, and documentation.
  - Keeps the focus on learning, clarity, and sustainable workflows.
  - Shows up in this org as structured notes, templates, and comments.

Think of AEP21 as a small human+AI team learning how to ship together in public.

## Philosophy

- **Transparent learning:** keep mistakes and experiments visible instead of hiding them.
- **Small steps, compounding:** tiny, boring improvements > big rewrites.
- **Teacher mindset:** everything should be explainable to a curious student.

If any of this resonates and you want to follow the journey, feel free to star, open issues, or just lurk and watch AEP21 evolve.
